//! Engine abstraction: the port traits every database engine adapter
//! implements. Slices depend only on these traits; engine-specific SQL and
//! drivers live exclusively in adapter modules under `crate::engines`
//! (`engines::sqlite` today; `engines::mysql` / `engines::postgres` in M12).
//!
//! M2 note: the original `SchemaReader` / `QueryExecutor` stub traits were
//! folded into [`EngineConnection`] — introspection and query execution are
//! operations *on an open connection*, so one object owning the driver
//! handle is the natural seam. [`DdlDialect`] remains a stub until M8/M14.
//!
//! # Async commands rule
//!
//! Any slice that touches a database MUST expose `async fn` Tauri commands
//! and these port traits are async (`async_trait`). Sync commands run on the
//! main thread, so a slow query or connection attempt would freeze the
//! entire UI for its duration.
//!
//! Driver caveats:
//! - `rusqlite` is synchronous and its `Connection` is `!Sync` — the SQLite
//!   adapter wraps it in `Arc<std::sync::Mutex<…>>` and hops every operation
//!   through `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so async executor threads never
//!   block (Tauri's async runtime *is* tokio).
//! - `sqlx` (MySQL/Postgres, M12) is natively async and can be awaited
//!   directly.
//!
//! The preferences slice is the one deliberate exception: it stays sync
//! because it only reads/writes a tiny local JSON file (see
//! `features::preferences`). Do not copy its sync commands into DB-touching
//! slices.

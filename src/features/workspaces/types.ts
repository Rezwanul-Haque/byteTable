 * Per-workspace UI state, preserved across workspace switches (spec §2:

 * Pattern: every piece of per-workspace UI state lives on the workspace
 * object under `ui`, keyed by workspace — so switching workspaces preserves
 * it for free and closing a workspace drops it with the object. Written via
 * the store's `patchWorkspaceUi(id, patch)` action. Later milestones keep
 * extending this type (M4: open tabs + active tab).
 *
 * Churn rule: only low-frequency state belongs here. High-frequency state
 * (scroll offsets, drag-in-progress) lives in refs/local component state and
 * is committed to `ui` only on tab/workspace switch or unmount — never on
 * every frame. The sidebar's search text is deliberately NOT here: it is
 * transient per-keystroke state, local to the component (prototype
 * behavior).
